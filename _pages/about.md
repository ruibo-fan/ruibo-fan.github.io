[cite_start]I am a 3rd-year Ph.D. candidate at the [Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou)](https://www.hkust-gz.edu.cn/), advised by Prof. [Xiaowen Chu](https://xiaowen-chu.github.io/) (Primary Advisor) and Prof. [Wei Wang](https://cse.hkust.edu.hk/~weiwa/) (Co-Advisor, HKUST CSE Department)[cite: 1, 6, 8, 31].

My research interests lie in **High-Performance Computing**, particularly focused on **GPU architecture and optimization**. [cite_start]I am currently investigating methods to accelerate sparse matrix operations and graph neural networks on modern GPU architectures[cite: 8, 26, 28, 33].

[cite_start]Prior to joining HKUST(GZ), I received my Master's degree from **Peking University** (2019-2022) at the Academy for Advanced Interdisciplinary Studies, and my Bachelor's degree from **Huazhong University of Science and Technology** (2015-2019) in the School of Artificial Intelligence and Automation[cite: 9, 10, 11, 23, 25].

I am passionate about bridging the gap between theoretical computer architecture and practical performance optimization for real-world applications. My goal is to develop efficient algorithms and systems that can fully utilize modern hardware capabilities to accelerate computational workloads across various domains including AI, scientific computing, and large-scale data processing.
