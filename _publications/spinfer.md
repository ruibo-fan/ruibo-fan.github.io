**SpInfer** exploits **low-level sparsity** in LLM computation on GPUs to accelerate inference. By co-designing sparse kernels, data layouts, and runtime scheduling, SpInfer reduces unnecessary computation and memory traffic while preserving model accuracy, achieving significantly lower latency and higher throughput compared to dense baselines.
