This work proposes **fast sparse GPU kernels** tailored for training **graph neural networks (GNNs)**. By carefully optimizing memory access patterns, load balancing, and sparse computation primitives, our kernels significantly reduce training time for a variety of GNN architectures and large-scale graph datasets.
