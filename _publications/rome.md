**ROME** targets the **all-pairs shortest path (APSP)** problem on GPUs and addresses the challenge of **fine-grained irregularities** in graph workloads. Through novel scheduling strategies and workload reorganization, ROME improves GPU utilization and achieves strong performance on a wide range of graph benchmarks.
