We present **DTC-SpMM**, a general sparse matrix multiplication framework that effectively utilizes **GPU Tensor Cores**. DTC-SpMM bridges the gap between irregular sparsity patterns and dense tensor-core-friendly computation via novel data layouts and kernel designs, delivering substantial speedups over existing SpMM implementations across diverse sparse workloads.
